# Compositionality By Segment Alignment

Measures compositionally in a language, using optimal weighted character alignment as a signal distance measure.

Optimal string alignment comes from LingPy.

Mantel test comes from Jon Carr:

Gerhard Jaeger has used alignment to look at differences between languages:

In particular, the SI describes how weighted alignment is done. They provide a matrix of similarities between phonemes, which could be used with this project:
